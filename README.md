# Rebind Narrator

Adds an option to the controls screen under "misc" to rebind the narrator key. That's all it does. ~~Fabric~~ Fabric and Forge ~~1.16.1~~ ~~1.17.0~~ 1.18.2.

NB: It won't work if you bind it to things like mouse buttons or anything else that doesn't have a scan code.

## Fabric version

AMECS integration. If you have [AMECS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/amecs) installed, it will honor your choice of modifier keys & allow for multiple keybindings. This is notable because the narrator key is processed super early on, way before the vanilla keybinds system/AMECS can have a say.

NMUK integration. If you have [No More Useless Keys](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nmuk) installed, it will honor your choice of alternate keybindings. Same deal here.

## Forge version

Will honor your choice of modifier key in the Forge keybindings screen.
